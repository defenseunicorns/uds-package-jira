# uds-package-jira
Bigbang [Jira](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/product/community/jira) deployed via flux by zarf

## Deployment Prerequisites

### Resources
- Minimum compute requirements for single node deployment are at LEAST 64 GB RAM and 32 virtual CPU threads (aws `m6i.8xlarge` instance type should do)
- k3d installed on machine

#### General

- Create `jira` namespace
- Label `jira` namespace with `istio-injection: enabled`

#### Database

- A Postgres database is running on port `5432` and accessible to the cluster
- This database can be logged into via the user configured with the zarf var `JIRA_DB_USERNAME`. Default is `jira`
- This database instance has a psql database configured with the zarf var `JIRA_DB_NAME`. Default is `jiradb`
- The user has read/write access to the above mentioned database
- Create `jira-postgres` service in `jira` namespace that points to the psql database
- Create `jira-postgres` secret in `jira` namespace with the key `password` that contains the password to the user for the psql database

## Deploy

### Use zarf to login to the needed registries i.e. registry1.dso.mil

```bash
# Download Zarf
make build/zarf

# Login to the registry
set +o history

# registry1.dso.mil (To access registry1 images needed during build time)
export REGISTRY1_USERNAME="YOUR-USERNAME-HERE"
export REGISTRY1_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
echo $REGISTRY1_TOKEN | build/zarf tools registry login registry1.dso.mil --username $REGISTRY1_USERNAME --password-stdin

set -o history
```

### Build and Deploy Everything via Makefile and local package

```bash
# This will run make build/all, make cluster/reset, and make deploy/all. Follow the breadcrumbs in the Makefile to see what and how its doing it.
make all
```
